# Higher-Lower Game

This is a fun and interactive Higher or Lower game based on cricket legends and their career runs. The game challenges players to guess which cricketer has scored more runs in international cricket.

How It Works:

1. The game randomly selects two cricketers from a pre-defined database.
2. Their names, countries, and batting styles are displayed.
3. The player must guess who has scored more runs by selecting '1' or '2'.
4. If the guess is correct, the score increases, and the game continues with the higher-scoring player.
5. If the guess is wrong, the game ends, and the final score is displayed.
6. The goal is to get the highest possible score before making an incorrect guess.
7. This game tests cricket knowledge and decision-making skills in an exciting way! 🏆🔥
